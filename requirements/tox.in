# Pin all of these versions for the same reason you ever want to pin
# anything: to prevent new releases with regressions from introducing
# spurious failures into CI runs for whatever development work is
# happening at the time.  The versions selected here are just the current
# versions at the time.  Bumping them to keep up with future releases is
# fine as long as those releases are known to actually work.
