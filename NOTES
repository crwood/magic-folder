remotesnapshotdb:
  - filename -> snapshot capability mapping
  - contains our local view of our personal DMD
  - we always write to this, and only then update the personal DMD
    - thus, this will always be equal to, or (CHECKME) a descendant of the
      snapshot in the personal DMD
  - calling this "remote_snapshots" is misleading, since we don't track snapshots
    from other particpants here
