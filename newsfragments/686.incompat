The /status endpoint now produces event-based output

This means the messages emitted via the WebSocket are entirely different.
Please see the documentation under "Status API" for the new method.
Ordinarily, this would mean a new version of the API (e.g. /v2/) but we
do not yet declare a stable /v1 API so it has simply changed.

Please get in touch if this causes you problems.
